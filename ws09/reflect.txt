In the following workshop, I learned the concept of dynamic memory 
allocation, about constructor, destructor, and about copy assignment, i.e. 
rule of three. I learned how to allocate, dealocate and how to use 
copy assignment in the code. The rule of three ensures that the objects which
we create are assigned properly, destructed properly and assigned to 
different objects properly. I learned that before using copy 
assignment we should so some initial checks. The checks include -
first check for self assignment, if the resource is assigned to 
itself or not. Then it is important to delete the previously 
allocated dynamic memory. And at the end we should execute deep
copy.

 The other thing I learned some part of file stream library.
 I learned how to open a file, and how to write in a file.
