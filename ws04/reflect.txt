From this workshop I learned about constructors, destructors and using current
object (this). 

All the classes provide us with some special features for allocating memory, instance 
variables, privacy constructor and destructor.
Constructors are special member functions that initializes the objects of class at real time.
The construction is created automatically when we use our function i.e. when we create an object.
There are mainly two types of constructors default and paramaterized constructor. Default
constructor are with no argument and other with arguments. The constructor is called or executed
automatically when a member function is called at the time of execution. A constructor do not return 
anything.

Destructor indicates the end of an object lifetime. Destructors are the special member function
that we use to deallocate the dynamic memory of an object by which we can prevent memory leaks.
The destructor object is also called automatically. We cannot overload or call a destructor 
explicitly. The destructor have no parameters and also they do not return any values or function 
or anything. However, destructors is the special object that invokes at the time of destruction.
Destructor are always destroyed in reverse order of their creation as, an object which are created
later may use the previously created object. Destructor deallocates the memory before going out
of scope.

Another concept is using a reference of a current object. ‘This’ keyword is used To refer to 
the current object. The this keyword holds the address of the current object and we use 
*this to refer the current object itself. However, this keyword is meaningless outside a member 
function.
