Throughout this workshop, I learned about dynamic memory allocation and 
management. I gained a some understanding of how to allocate, utilize, 
and deallocate memory dynamically. The main concept was the utilization
of memory and using new keyword to allocate memory and the delete keyword to
 deallocate it. As proper deallocation is very important to prevent 
 memory leaks, which are significant errors that can arise if memory 
 is not deallocated properly.

 During the project, I encountered some challenges, mostly with the 
 load function, which was use to data from a file. I faced difficulties 
 when the function indicated an error that the file data was corrupted,
  which was later tracked that I accidently made changes to the file. 
  Additionally, I encountered issues with garbage values being 
  displayed due to formatting mistakes. Furthermore, I encountered
   a compile-time error when attempting to submit the code, which 
   was caused as I was passing arguments to a function which was not required.
