From this workshop, I learned many different topics, some of them are from the previous semester and some are from this semester.
I learned many concepts such as how to address complexity in the code, for instance how we can make our code.
more readable, less complex, and easy to maintain. In this workshop, I divided all the parts of the code.
into different understandable parts, which is known as modularity. We divide different segments of the code into
various modules like - .h (header file), and .cpp file. In the code, all small functions are bifurcated under.
one single main function. like all the file functions are addressed in a different file all header file functions
are in a different file as well. The header file contains the function INITIALIZATION and .cpp file.
 which Contains its definition of all the functions which are declared. Furthermore, I learned about namespaces, modularity,
functions, functions declaration, standard library, and other c libraries that we can use. By evaluating the code
I also learn some concepts of debugging the code.
