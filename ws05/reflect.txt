I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the
code that my professor provided to complete my workshops
and assignments.

********************************************************/
In this following workshop, I learned how we can overload the operators, 
casting the operators and using helper functions.

Helper functions are also called global functions, these global functions
can use members of both private or public data members and also member
functions. The helper functions also refer to the class that 
supports through explicit parameters. Helper operators are the
operators that do not change the value of their operands.

The main purpose of helper functions is to implement input and output 
operations. We also use temporary objects to overload the operators 
to easily localize validation logic.

Furthermore, I learned that we can only overload some operators and
we cannot overload all the operators. 


Cast operators explicitly change one type into another, such as converting an
integer to a float. We can write functions in your class to handle these conversions.
Using the explicit keyword ensures that these changes happen if we want to.
